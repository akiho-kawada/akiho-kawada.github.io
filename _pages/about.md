Hello, my name is Akiho Kawada (in Japanese 河田 顕帆).

I'm an undergrad (final year) at [Systems Innovation, Faculty of Engineering, the University of Tokyo](https://www.si.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yutaka Matsuo](https://ymatsuo.com/en/) and [Prof. Yusuke Iwasawa](https://sites.google.com/view/yusuke-iwasawa/home). <br>
I’m currently working closely with [Prof. Udit Gupta](https://ugupta.com/) at Cornell Tech.
<!-- Additionally, I am currently a visiting student researcher in [Computer Architecture Lab](https://www.arch.cs.ucsb.edu/) at [the University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Jonathan Balkind](https://jbalkind.github.io/). -->
<!-- I am also spending some time at [Kosuge Lab](https://klab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) at the University of Tokyo as a research intern, under the supervision of [Prof. Atsutake Kosuge](https://sites.google.com/view/atsutakekosuge/). -->

My primary research interest lies in **computer architecture**, particularly in achieving high performance in computing systems through holistic approaches such as **software-hardware co-design**. I am particularly interested in areas such as **systems for machine learning** and **heterogeneous computing**.

<u>I aim to pursue a Ph.D. in electrical engineering / computer sciences at universities in the US or Canada, starting in the fall of 2026 after earning my bachelor's degree.</u>
