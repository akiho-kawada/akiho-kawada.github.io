Hello, my name is Akiho Kawada (in Japanese 河田 顕帆).

I'm currently an undergrad (4th year) at [Systems Innovation, Faculty of Engineering, the University of Tokyo](https://www.si.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/). <br>
I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yutaka Matsuo](http://ymatsuo.com/index.html) at [Prof. Yusuke Iwasawa](https://sites.google.com/view/yusuke-iwasawa/home) at [Matsuo-Iwasawa Lab](https://weblab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/). <br>
I am also spending some time at [Kosuge Lab](https://klab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) at the University of Tokyo as a research intern, under the supervision of [Prof. Atsutake Kosuge](https://sites.google.com/view/atsutakekosuge/).

My primary research interests are centered around hardware architecture (especially for AI/ML applications) and software-hardware co-design.

I aim to pursue a Ph.D. in electrical engineering / computer sciences at universities in the US or Europe after earning my bachelor's degree.
